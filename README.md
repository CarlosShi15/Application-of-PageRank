# Application-of-PageRank
project three in the course mathematical modeling

The project is an application of PageRank Algorithm. Our research aim to utilize pagerank to evaluate the cateens in SUSTech. 

The matlab code is to draw the markov chain based on the frequency matrix. And the vital procedure is to get the transitional matrix by the frequency matrix.

The java script is to dirctly order the eating choice that are favored by students. However, if somebody want to use the jave script, he has to take some actions first. Fisrt he need to call some libraries in the code. 

Further, since in our evaluation, we borrowed from the idea of a football match to get the comparing result of each two eating choice. Then using such ratio to get the matrix. And after applying the code, we will finally receive a stabilizing result, which is what we want. 

Eventually, the order of the result is the order of evaluation.
